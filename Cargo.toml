# While it’s possible to build a freestanding executable for Linux, Windows, and macOS, it’s probably not a good idea. 
# The reason is that our executable still expects various things, for example that a stack is initialized when the 
# _start function is called. Without the C runtime, some of these requirements might not be fulfilled, 
# which might cause our program to fail, e.g. through a segmentation fault.
